<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> PHP hasn't gone away,</h3>
<p>
  and there are still a huge number of sites out there making use of Wordpress, Drupal or custom PHP code. They're slow to respond, they often require Apache (massive .htaccess files anyone?), they have central points of failure (single MySQL master), they cache incredibly poorly (if at all), and they spend almost all their time serving static content off the disk (in the case of most blogs in 2015 - they're primarily serving photos.)
</p><p>
  So what to do? How does the state of the Cloud in 2015 help solve these problems? Let's first look at some of the primary problems with a typical Drupal7 installation:
</p><p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apache 2.2 is slow, and .htaccess files make things much slower (did you know they're searched for, read, interpretted, and executed on <i>every single web request</i>?)</li>
    <br>
    <li>MySQL is slow and fragile - with a single point of failure inherent in even Master-Slave replication setups. At the very best, a manual failover to the Slave server is required to bring things back online in the case of losing the Master. The MySQL server can run into common issues like hitting its "max connection" limit, taking down the entire site. In terms of performance, at least Drupal fails to read effectively from a slave, even with custom plugins, as it's reads and writes are so tightly coupled that even in large environments, it's very common for all nodes to <i>only ever</i> communicate with the Master, totally ignoring the Slave's read capacity.</li>
    <br>
    <li>PHP is slow, and if being run via MOD_PHP in Apache, is not taking advantage of the multiple cores of your system properly. It's probably not caching very well either - even if you're using APC cache or the newer APCu cache, they're terribly ineffective and not shared between PHP instances. Beyond that, since Apache recycles it's workers, the APC cache will be getting cleared constantly, further lowering cache hit rates.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Older servers are slow. Tech has improved a lot on the hardware side of things in the past 5 years - if you're still running PHP5.4, you're probably not running on a cost-effective system.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Caching is a problem, as well as serving static content - as anyone who has scaled a PHP application before knows, dealing with uploaded files is a nightmare and often includes another single point of failure as well as clunky and slow tools like LSYNC, NFS, or Gluster.</li>
  </ul>
</p><p>
<br>
<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> Now - Solutions!</h3>
</p><p>
  <ul>
    <li>Since .htaccess files can't easily be rewritten without a huge amount of effort, we'll continue to use Apache. But Apache has gotten a _lot_ faster in Apache 2.4 and with the "Event" worker module. We can continue to support the .htaccess rewrite rules, get all the benefits of a properly threaded web server, and we can make use of PHP-FPM to help speed up PHP.</li>
    <br>
    <li>MySQL has also gotten much much faster in the wake of MariaDB 10.0. MariaDB is a drop in replacement for MySQL which is fully compatible with Drupal 7, Wordpress, and more or less any PHP application. It also supports Master/Master replication, which will allow us to properly scale our PHP application across multiple nodes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>As mentioned before, Apache 2.4 allows us to make use of PHP-FPM (just like Nginx does), while still being able to support nasty legacty rewrite rules and .htaccess syntax. We'll also upgrade to a modern version of PHP, PHP5.6, and configure the vastly improved (yet very poorly documented) PHP OpCache module.</li>
    <br>
    <li>We'll upgrade to modern servers in our rebuild - with an eye for maximizing compute capacity for our dollar, as PHP applications are primary CPU bound, which some exception made for large MySQL databases, which will in turn require a large amount of RAM.</li>
    <br>
    <li>By making use of a CDN (such as Rackspace's Cloud Files) as well as Varnish4.0, we'll vastly improve the caching potential of our application while simultaniously offloading the vast majority of the file requests.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p><br><h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> Hit the ground running</h3></p>
<p>
  Let's start by building a new Ubuntu 14.04 server - I recommend Rackspace Performance Cloud servers. You can get a developer account with a nice discount here at <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/">developer.rackspace.com</a>. You can use whatever distribution you'd like, but this guide will be specific for Ubuntu 14.04. I recommend using something like Chef to automate this setup as well (and I'll provide a link to an example cookbook) - if you're not automating this, I recommend building on a fairly large server. As much as we'll improve things, PHP still scales best vertically. A small number of powerful servers will preform _far better_ than a large number of small servers. If you're looking for absolute best value for money, take a look at <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/onmetal">Rackspace OnMetal Compute</a> servers. They're expensive, but two of those babies behind a load balancer can host a massive national Drupal site without breaking a sweat. The 10,000mbps networking between servers also helps ensure MySQL master/master replication is extremely fast.
</p>
<p>Upgrading and updating your new server:</p>
<p><kbd>&gt; apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get -y upgrade &amp;&amp; reboot</kbd></p>

<p>Since we'll be using Varnish to cache for Apache, make sure you're Apache instance isn't listening directly on port 80. I typically set Apache to port 8080, while Varnish will take care of proxy requests from 80 to Apache's 8080.</p>

<p><br><h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> MariaDB 10.0 Galera Cluster &amp; tuning</h3></p>
<p>MariaDB 10.0 contains countless improvements over older MySQL 5.5 distributions. In addition, we'll configure our databases as a Master/Master cluster - this is called "Galera Clustering" in MariaDB. I strongly suggest all experienced MySQL users read the official guide to Galera, <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/documentation/managing-mariadb/replication/galera/getting-started-with-mariadb-galera-cluster/">located here</a>.</p>
<p>Add repositories for MariaDB 10.0:</p>
<p><kbd>&gt; apt-get install software-properties-common</kbd></p>
<p><kbd>&gt; apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 0xcbcb082a1bb943db</kbd></p>
<p><kbd>&gt; add-apt-repository 'deb http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/mariadb/repo/10.0/ubuntu trusty main'</kbd></p>
<p><kbd>&gt; apt-get update</kbd></p>
<p>Install MariaDB 10.0 Galera server</p>
<p><kbd>&gt; mariadb-galera-server</kbd></p>
<p>Galera Clustering is not terribly difficult, although it's highly recommended that one reads the above link regarding Getting Started with Galera. In the most basic setup, we really only need to enable a few things in our <i>my.cnf</i>:</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-bash">
# Turn on Galera Clustering\n
wsrep_on                 = ON\n
wsrep_provider           = /usr/lib/galera/libgalera_smm.so\n
# Ensure PRIVATE_NETWORK_ADDRESS is a protected private network\n
# like Rackspace's ServiceNet, for instance.\n
# wsrep_node_address and wsrep_node_incoming_address are used to\n
# fix potential problems with autodetecting\n
bind-address             = PRIVATE_NETWORK_ADDRESS\n
wsrep_node_address       = PRIVATE_NETWORK_ADDRESS:4567\n
wsrep_node_incoming_address = PRIVATE_NETWORK_ADDRESS\n
\n
# On your FIRST server, start MySQL with the following setting:\n
wsrep_cluster_address    = gcomm://\n
# On the SECOND server, start MySQL with the following:\n
wsrep_cluster_address    = gcomm://IPADDRESS_OF_FIRST_SERVER\n
# After starting the 2nd server and ensuring it joins the cluster, change the wsrep_cluster_address\n
# back on the 1st server to point to the 2nd. This way each server can "rejoin" the cluster after a restart\n
wsrep_cluster_address    = gcomm://IPADDRESS_OF_SECOND_SERVER\n
# Should you create a 3rd server, you'll only need to provide one address of either cluster node\n
# and Galera will figure everything else out for you.\n
\n
# A static name which must be the same on all nodes\n
wsrep_cluster_name       = "my_cluster_name"\n
wsrep_sst_method         = 'rsync'\n
# A MYSQL user with all permissions used for Galera Replication\n
wsrep_sst_auth           = root:MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD\n
\n
# Some INNODB settings are _required_ for Galera\n
binlog_format            = ROW\n
innodb_autoinc_lock_mode = 2\n
innodb_doublewrite       = 1
  </code>
</pre>
<p>You may notice the port "4567" in the config. That's Galera, which helps monitor the servers and helps new nodes join. Make sure your firewall allows your servers to communicate on both ports 3306 and 4567.</p>

<p>
  Drupal's <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/varnish">Varnish module</a> really isn't bad, but it lacks support for Varnish 4.0. Luckily, there exists a <a href="http://cgit.drupalcode.org/varnish/">development version</a> of the module which supports Varnish 4.0 and works wonderfully. You can clone that repo into your "DOCROOT/sites/all/modules/" directory:

  I'll leave configuration of the Varnish module as an excercize to the reader - however, ensure you set a Varnish secret and make sure Drupal can communicate with Varnish correctly. You'll also want to make sure you select "4.x" from the dropdown menu regarding Varnish's versions.

  Drupal's <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/redis">Redis module</a> is also not bad, but you're much better off getting the newest version from the developers:
</p>
<p><kbd>&gt; git clone http://git.drupal.org/project/redis.git</kbd></p>

  Using a CDN - Cloud Files and CDN modules. The Rackspace <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/cloud_files">Cloud Files module</a> is quite good, but lacks a few crucial patches and bug fixes - additionally, it uploads all files over PublicNet, rather than Rackspace's ServerNet. Checkout my branch, located <a href="https://github.com/erulabs/drupal7_cloud_files">on github</a>. Incase you do not want to use ServiceNet, read the README document and remove references to "internalUrl" in the code.
